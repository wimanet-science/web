#### Haemosporidian parasites: 
The sequences in MalAvi are available to download in [Fasta-Format](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/fastaformat/). You can choose either to download all sequences or just sequences that are complete between positions 50-450 bp in the MalAvi region of the cytochrome b gene (Long sequences). Additionally, you can choose to only download sequences linked to morphologically identified species.
