Working group 6 (WG6) focus on coordinating and disseminating WIMANET’s research, ensuring that findings reach both the scientific community and the broader public. The group actively manages WIMANET’s communication channels, including a dedicated website, social media platforms ([Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/wimanetscience/), [X](https://x.com/WIMANETscience), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRlX_xLduIAgMsYk3p5EK7g), Wikipedia, and a regular newsletter featuring research highlights, member updates, and opportunities for collaboration (click [here](https://wimanet-science.github.io/web/contact/) to subscribe).<br>
WG6 is also responsible for organizing outreach and training initiatives, such as summer schools, where participants gain hands-on experience with wildlife malaria research techniques, and the creation of training videos to support capacity building. To enhance visibility at conferences and public events, the group is developing multilingual brochures to effectively communicate WIMANET’s mission across diverse audiences. <br>
In addition, WG6 contributes to scientific dissemination by preparing meeting reports for publication in academic journals, summarizing key discussions and advancements from WIMANET events. The group is continuously looking for ways to expand its impact and is seeking volunteers to support activities such as conducting interviews for the newsletter, managing social media outreach, and creating blog posts to highlight WIMANET’s progress.<br>
By fostering strong communication and engagement, WG6 ensures that WIMANET’s research gains the recognition it deserves and inspires further collaboration within the wildlife malaria research community.
