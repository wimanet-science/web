## Interviews of 2026

### Vaidas Palinauskas
Recorded during the WIMANET workshop in Lithuania, this interview features Vaidas Palinauskas, chief researcher at the Nature Research Centre in Vilnius, Lithuania.
Vaidas works on haemosporidian parasites, with a particular focus on avian malaria parasites. His research includes species identification, the study of host–parasite interactions, and other key aspects needed to understand the dynamics of these infections in wildlife.
In this interview, Vaidas highlights that his main motivation for joining WIMANET was to build connections and to have a platform to share his experience with the new generation of researchers, emphasizing the importance of collaboration and networking with researchers from other countries.

## Interviews of 2025

### Josué Martínez de la Puente
During the second workshop held in Lithuania, we recorded a series of interviews to share with people what our members do.
Today, we start with Josué Martínez-de la Puente, the leader of Working Group 3: "Vector transmission success in wildlife malaria".
He is a PI working at the Doñana Biological Station in Seville, Spain, studying how different vector characteristics — such as their microbiome, diets, or environment — can influence the transmission of avian malaria. Here, Josué talks about his research on the role of mosquitoes in transmitting avian malaria parasites and shares how being part of WIMANET has benefited him and his team.
