  description: Since her PhD, Tamara studied avian malaria parasites and host-parasite interactions and she started co-curating the [MalAvi database](http://130.235.244.92/Malavi/) from 2021. Tamara is now working as a museum curator, but keeps collaborating with the wildlife malaria network as the Science Communications Co-ordinator of WIMANET.

- name: Nayden Chakarov
  role: Working group leader WG1 # Will appear next to name
  image: /assets/images/naycha.jpg # Can be external link
  description: Nayden is an avid (and occasionally desperate) field biologist, keen on finding and understanding animals (mostly birds) whatever they do and wherever they go. This is a slippery slope, which leads him up trees, through diverse ecological interactions, into the blood and down to molecular genomics, metabolites and single-cell interactions. Digs particularly Leucocytozoon.

  image: /assets/images/josmar.jpg # Can be external link
  description: Josue studies the ecology and evolution of parasite transmission networks. Throughout his career, he has used a wide range of approaches combining the extensive monitoring of natural processes and experimental procedures in the wild and in the laboratory. He is leading WG3 on the study of vectors of wildlife malaria.

  description: Since his PhD, Swen worked on bird-environmental interactions and how land use change is affecting bird communities. Since 2014 he studied effects of Haemosporidians within global change responses to wildlife malaria. Swen is senior researcher and curator for ornithology at the [NHM Wien](https://www.nhm-wien.ac.at/swen_renner) and lead of WG4 of WIMANET.

  image: /assets/images/kasbod.jpg # Can be external link
  description: Kasun is an evolutionary and community ecologist, with main research interests in understanding the drivers of host-symbiont associations and microbial communities. His work mainly focuses on animal associated symbionts, such as gut and uropygial gland microbiomes and avian-haemosporidian interactions. He is leading WG5 on multi host-parasite communities. Also see his [personal website](https://kasunbodawatta.com/).

  image: /assets/images/marfer.jpg # Can be external link
  description: Martina explores ecological impacts on mosquito-borne diseases. In her postdocs (JdC and MSCA-IF), she delved into host-pathogen dynamics and developed epidemiological models for vector-borne diseases. Since 2023, she holds a Ram√≥n y Cajal position at EBD-CSIC. In WIMANET, she leads WG6 - Coordinating & Implementing CBOs. Explore further on her [webpage](https://martinaferraguti.com/).
