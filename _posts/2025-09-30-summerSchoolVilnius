A month ago was held the second WIMANET Summer School in the city of Vilnius, at the Life Science Centre, with participants from 14 countries. The 21 students learnt from 7 teachers on the topics of hematology, blood parasites in birds, reptiles and amphibians, and histological investigations for the parasites’ tissue stages. It was microscopy-intensive but the students were very motivated! They had small projects to investigate during the course, allowing them to put in practice and show what they learnt during those five day!
