## What are STSMs ? 
Short-term scientific missions (STSM) are exchange visits between researchers involved in a COST Action, allowing scientists to visit an institution or laboratory in another COST Member state  participating  in  WIMANET.  These  scientific  missions  have  a  maximum  budget  of  **EUR 4,000**,  and  a  **minimum  duration  of  7  days**.  Their  aim  is  to  foster  collaboration  in  excellent research infrastructures and share new techniques that may not be available in a participant’s home institution or laboratory. 
  
## Who can apply? 
Short-term scientific missions are open to all members of WIMANET based in a COST Member state or NNC participating in WIMANET. 
 
## How to Apply? 
This round of applications for STSMs will close on **31st January 2026**; late applications may be considered if budget allows.
