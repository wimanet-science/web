We have a [press release](/assets/docs/WIMANETpressRelease_EN.docx) to announce the start of the network, which was drafted by Martina Ferraguti (WG6 Lead) with contributions of Jenny Dunn (Action Chair) and Tamara Emmenegger (Science Communication Coordinator). It would be great if you, as a WIMANET working Group member, or other members of the wildlife malaria community could circulate this to the press office at your institution, so we can spread word of the network as wide as possible.

Update: The press release was translated and disseminated in [Germany](https://www.uni-hohenheim.de/pressemitteilung?tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=60998&cHash=044980396de6ad4c48172e05b2ca236c), [Spain](http://www.ebd.csic.es/inicio/-/asset_publisher/DAWYgEgZTzIn/content/la-estacion-biologica-de-donana-participa-en-la-wildlife-malaria-network-wimanet-?_101_INSTANCE_DAWYgEgZTzIn_redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebd.csic.es%2Finicio%3Fp_p_id%3D101_INSTANCE_DAWYgEgZTzIn%26p_p_lifecycle%3D0%26p_p_state%3Dnormal%26p_p_mode%3Dview%26p_p_col_id%3Dcolumn-3%26p_p_col_count%3D1&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebd.csic.es%2Finicio%3Fp_p_id%3D101_INSTANCE_DAWYgEgZTzIn%26p_p_lifecycle%3D0%26p_p_state%3Dnormal%26p_p_mode%3Dview%26p_p_col_id%3Dcolumn-3%26p_p_col_count%3D1) [Lithuania](https://gamtostyrimai.lt/nauja-tarptautine-iniciatyva-tirti-kraujasiurbiu-vabzdziu-platinamus-parazitus-wildlife-malaria-network-wimanet/) and the [UK](https://news.lincoln.ac.uk/2024/01/17/lincoln-to-lead-global-initiative-to-study-vector-borne-malaria-parasites-in-wildlife/).
