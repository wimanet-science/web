A month ago was held the second WIMANET Workshop in the city of Vilnius, at the Lithuanian Academy of Sciences. A total of 82 participants from 23 countries joined in person and online for updates on works from the Network, interesting discussions and plans for the upcoming year (activities, next summer school, next workshop/conference, possible fundings, etc.). The WG leads presented the progress and different activities of their working group, while 20 speakers presented their work related to the WG objectives, most of which derived from STSMs, Summer School and new collaborations outputs. The Core Group also meet up, addressing reports and next year planning.
