Our new article published in *Integrative Zoology* introduces WIMANET to the research community and stakeholders interested in wildlife malaria.
Since WIMANET was launched in 2023, over 140 scientists from 37 countries have joined the network to conribute to a better understanding of these parasites and how they affect wildlife. The article outlines the goals and achievements of our six working groups and how WIMANET will strengthen the network over the next three years and beyond.
